# crm-yii2

This is a small CRM project I developed using Yii2 framework as part of my self-learning. You can use it at your own risk.

# Installation
* Install composer
* Install composer asset plugin by executing console command `composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.2.0"`
* Clone the project and install Yii2 packages by executing command `composer update`
* Setup your web server and database based on configuration file you would like to use. ie: open `config/db.php` for development environment settings.
* Run migrations by executing command `yii migrate`
* Once all migrations are executed successfully, open application in your browser and use credentials in the seeder `migrations/m151102_000902_seed_users_table.php`
* If you get some error messages related to **AppDbManager** class, it means framework updates are incompatible with the modified `helpers\AppDbManager.php` caching component. You can quickly solve this by editing `config/web.php` so that uncomment line 75, comment lines 77 & 78. It should look like this:
```
      'class' => 'yii\rbac\DbManager',
      // superchaching below: 60 second timeout + per request caching
      //'class' => 'app\helpers\AppDbManager',
      //'cache' => 'yii\caching\FileCache'
```

# Features
